                “When I was ten, I attempted to rescue a pigeon that had broken
                its wing and was unable to fly over the four foot walls of my
                terrace. I wrapped it in a blanket and tried to feed it and give
                it water, but it lost its will to live and died within the hour.
                I cried myself to sleep that night. A few years later, I found a
                kitten near a nearby paanwala that I christened Chicken. He was
                an adorable little scamp that I wanted to take home with me, but
                my parents convinced me that I would never be able to take care
                of him and that he was better off being a street cat. The
                weekend after that, I went to check up on Chicken to see how he
                was doing and I found out from the paanwala that a car ran over
                him killed him. I cried that entire weekend. Years later, when I
                graduated from junior college, my then-girlfriend found a kitten
                on the street. She had a dog at the time and couldn’t shelter
                the kitten for very long. She told me that despite her best
                efforts nobody wanted to adopt the kitten and she’d have to
                release her kitten back on the street. That day, I adopted
                Cinnamon, my first cat. Cinnamon was a white kitten that
                fashioned herself a bit of a daredevil—she loved climbing onto
                chajjas. We had to call the fire department once when she
                climbed up a tree and we couldn’t get her down (credit to the
                fire department, not only did they come swiftly and promptly,
                they even came up with an innovative solution of getting her
                down when the fire engine couldn’t reach through the cramped
                space behind the building). I went to university and came back
                for my winter vacations hoping to see her again. It was then
                that I discovered that her daredevil days had resulted in the
                inevitable—she had slipped and fallen six floors where she lay
                dead on the tiles of my building parking lot. I was so shocked
                and depressed. I couldn’t adjust to the sudden emptiness in my
                house. A long time had passed after Cinnamon’s death by the time
                Pepper came into our lives. I was with my friend Harish when we
                found an abandoned kitten mewing and crying in fear while
                attempting to take shelter underneath a car. He was dirty, sick,
                lonely, and scared. He was a runt: too small, weak, and sickly
                to fend for himself. I couldn’t turn my back on him. We wrapped
                him in a blanket and rushed him back from Andheri to Santacruz.
                During the journey, he defecated on every hand except mine. It
                was then that I suspected that Pepper had grown attached to me.
                We nursed him back from the brink of death (the vet said he
                wouldn’t make it past a month when she first saw him) and he
                grew up into a healthy, dim-witted, cowardly cat. He lived for
                six years—he died nine months ago of acute kidney failure.
                Pepper bhai was a handsome cat. We used to call him a supermodel
                cat because he was very good looking but utterly inept at
                everything else— scared of heights, couldn’t hunt to save his
                life, clumsy beyond all clumsiness. He had no other life skills
                outside of looking dashingly handsome. We loved him dearly and
                he loved my dad the most. Dad wanted to cut back on his
                cholesterol intake so he would give Pepper the yellow of his
                boiled egg every morning for six years. When dad came back from
                work, Pepper would go to him and complain about his problems.
                Then there was the post-dinner chin-scratching and cuddling that
                he would take only from dad and no one else. Sure, I was the one
                who rescued him and gave him a home, but he was clearly dad’s
                cat. We haven’t adopted a new cat since his death. No one in the
                family has recovered from the loss. He was part of the family
                and we can’t bear the thought of replacing him. ” - John
